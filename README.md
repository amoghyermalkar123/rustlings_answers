Rustlings solved. The answers in here while do pass rustlings tests can't be considered idiomatic rust everytime.
I did not use the hints command for any question in the questionnaire and all i referred to was the official rust documentation.
Answers in here are what i could come up with as i learned from the compiler and the rust doc.
There can be better ways to answer some questions than what i could come up with here, idk.
